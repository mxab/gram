== Context path

Sometimes your site not directly hosted on the root level, let's assume it runs under `/foo` (e.g. `https://example.org/foo/`)

When setting the `contextPath` value in the `gram` extension the template and preview task take this into account.

.build.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
gram {
  contextPath = "/foo"
}
----

In Thymeleaf `th:href=@{/bar}` will result in `href="/foo/bar"`.

The preview task will serve everything under `/foo`
