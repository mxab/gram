= Layouting
gram uses Thymeleaf to layout the page.

The idea of Thymeleaf is to have valid HTML source code that even may contain sample data.
It uses special attributes for example `th:...` to that are getting picked up by the engine

== Template

As your default layout put a `default.html` inside of `src/templates`

.src/templates/default.html
[source,html]
----
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en" xmlns:th="http://www.thymeleaf.org">
<body>
<p>This is my website</p>
<div th:insert="${content} :: #content">
</body>
----

The template engine processes every output of your content (asciidoc files)
The `${content}` reflects the output of one asciidoc file (have a look at `build/content`)

== Gradle Task

The Gradle task `generateHTML` processes all outputs of your content files.
Currently every file `<name>.adoc` will result in a `build/pages/<name>/index.html`. Except `index.adoc` files, they will stay on the same level.
